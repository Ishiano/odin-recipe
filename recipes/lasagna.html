    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef*</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 15-ounce package whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups shredded mozzarella, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9x13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until the beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes. Make sure to crumble the beef as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, and beaten egg; set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the tomato mixture onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat for a second layer. Top with the remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagna into the preheated oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until the top is browned in spots.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes. Serve, garnished with parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
